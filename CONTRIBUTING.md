First of all, thank you for your interest in GotchangPDF! We'd love to accept your patches and contributions!

## How to report a bug

**TODO public issue tracker - Wordpress forum?**

Create a new thread at the "public issue tracker".
If you are already a customer with paid support,
please use the paid support section.

Bug report should consist of a few useful information:
* the version of GotchangPDF you are using
* the version of operating system you are using
* the description of the actual result (what is actually happening) and the expected result (what would you expect to happen instead)
* snippet of the problematic code
* source document (if the document is confidential, please use out "document anonymizer")

Shortly after, you will be notified from the support team.
Confirmed issues will be assigned internal issue ID
and you will be notified, when the issue is resolved.

In any other case please contact the support team
at [info@gotchangpdf.com](mailto:info@gotchangpdf.com).
